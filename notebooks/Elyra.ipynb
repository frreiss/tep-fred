Interest expense increased to $214 million compared with $71 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to the increase in debt to finance the company\\'s accelerated share repurchase agreements executed in the second quarter. \\n\\nIBM\\'s effective tax rate in the fourth-quarter 2007 was 28.0 percent, flat compared with the fourth quarter of 2006. \\n\\nThe weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding in the fourth-quarter 2007 was 1.41 billion compared with 1.53 billion shares in the same period of 2006. \\n\\nFull-Year 2007 Results \\n\\nDiluted earnings of $7.18 per share, up 18 percent as reported; \\nTotal revenues of $98.8 billion, up 8 percent; \\nGlobal Technology Services revenues up 12 percent; pre-tax income up 8 percent; \\nGlobal Business Services revenues up 13 percent; pre-tax income up 21 percent; \\nSoftware revenues up 10 percent; pre-tax income up 9 percent. \\nIncome from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $10.4 billion compared with $9.4 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 11 percent. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $7.18, including a gain from the sale of the Printing Systems Division in the second quarter, an increase of 18 percent, compared with $6.06 per diluted share in 2006. Revenues from continuing operations for 2007 totaled $98.8 billion, an increase of 8 percent (4 percent, adjusting for currency), compared with $91.4 billion in 2006. \\n\\nFrom a geographic perspective, the Americas\\' full-year revenues were $41.1 billion, an increase of 4 percent as reported (3 percent, adjusting for currency) from the 2006 period. Revenues from Europe/Middle East/Africa were $34.7 billion, an increase of 14 percent (5 percent, adjusting for currency). Asia-Pacific revenues increased 11 percent (8 percent, adjusting for currency) to $19.5 billion. OEM revenues were $3.5 billion, down 10 percent compared with 2006. \\n\\nRevenues from the Global Technology Services segment totaled $36.1 billion, an increase of 12 percent (7 percent, adjusting for currency) compared with 2006. Revenues from the Global Business Services segment were $18.0 billion, up 13 percent (9 percent, adjusting for currency). Systems and Technology segment revenues were $21.3 billion, a decrease of 3 percent (6 percent, adjusting for currency). Software segment revenues in 2007 totaled $20.0 billion, an increase of 10 percent (6 percent, adjusting for currency). Global Financing segment revenues totaled $2.5 billion, an increase of 6 percent (2 percent, adjusting for currency). \\n\\nFor total operations, net income for 2007 was $10.4 billion, or $7.18 per diluted share, compared with the 2006 net income of $9.5 billion, or $6.11 per diluted share, which included a gain from discontinued operations related to country tax settlements of $76 million. \\n\\nIBM ended 2007 with $16.1 billion of cash on hand and free cash flow of $12.4 billion, up 1.9 billion year over year. The balance sheet remains strong, and the company is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities. \\n\\nShare repurchases totaled approximately $18.8 billion in 2007, including $12.5 billion executed through accelerated share repurchase agreements in May. The repurchases are part of the $15 billion authorization for the company\\'s stock repurchase program approved by the IBM board of directors on April 24. \\n\\nThe weighted-average number of diluted common shares outstanding in 2007 was 1.45 billion compared with 1.55 billion shares in 2006. As of December 31, 2007, there were 1.39 billion basic common shares outstanding. \\n\\nDebt, including Global Financing, totaled $35.3 billion, compared with $22.7 billion at year-end 2006. From a management segment view, Global Financing debt increased $2.2 billion from year-end 2006 to a total of $24.5 billion, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 7.1 to 1. The non- global financing debt-to-capitalization ratio was 30.0 percent at the end of 2007, which reflects increased financial leverage associated with the accelerated share repurchase agreements. \\n\\nForward-Looking and Cautionary Statements\\nExcept for the historical information and discussions contained herein, statements contained in this release may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
